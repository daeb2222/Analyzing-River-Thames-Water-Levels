I started this project with the purpose of practicing Data Analysis Skills, it was started from DataCamp Real World Projects and I am adding a few extras.

It is a comprehensive analysis of tidal data from the Thames River, focusing on the frequency and characteristics of high and low tides over time. The analysis includes:

Data Loading and Preparation: Loading tidal data from data/10-11_London_Bridge.txt, followed by data cleaning and structuring to facilitate analysis.

Statistical Analysis: Calculation of mean, median, and interquartile ranges for both high and low tides, with results stored in separate pandas Series.

Annual High Tide Analysis: Determination of the annual percentage of days experiencing very high tide levels (above the 90th percentile), with results compiled into a DataFrame.

Annual Low Tide Analysis: Calculation of the annual percentage of days with very low tide levels (below the 10th percentile), similarly compiled into a DataFrame.

Summary: Creation of a dictionary named solution encapsulating the key findings, including high and low tide statistics and the ratios of very high and very low tide days.

Visualization: Determination of hypothesis with the resulten exmination of data and plot it to confirm.
